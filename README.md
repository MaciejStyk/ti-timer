# Twilight Imperium 4 timer

This is the timer app for the board game Twilight Imperium 4th Edition. 

If you want you can reach out to me via maciej.styk@gmail.com about any bugs or fixes.

There are no "undo" or "return" buttons so sensitive plays like playing strategy action, resetting whole app or passing players are possible via double click. The rest is normally clickable. 

There is also no "Checks and Balances" law panel. Just swap picked strategy cards at the end of Strategy Phase (always enabled in case of misspicks).

## General hot keys:

### enter - end turn
### space - pause timer
### ctrl + enter - pass

## Strategy phase hot keys:

### [number] - pick or unpick strategy card [number]
### double click on strategy card - pick or unpick

## Action phase hot keys:
