# Twilight Imperium 4 timer

This is the timer app for the board game **Twilight Imperium 4th Edition** that I have written in order to shorten our playtime and to be able to focus more on the game itself rather than keeping up with the correct order which changes often. 

If you want, you can reach out to me via maciej.styk@gmail.com about any bugs or fixes.

Have fun and most of all - quicker games!

## Keep in mind: ##

- There are no "undo" or "return" buttons so sensitive plays like playing strategy action, resetting whole app or passing players are possible via double click. The rest is normally clickable. 
- There is also no "Checks and Balances" law panel. Just swap picked strategy cards at the end of Strategy Phase (always enabled in case of misspicks).
- App is not for mobiles, normal and big screens only.


## General hot keys:
